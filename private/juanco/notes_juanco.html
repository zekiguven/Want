<h1>Notes on Want Development</h1>
<p><i>by Juanco Añez</i></p>
<h2><a href="uris_juanco.html">URIs</a></h2>
<p>Notes on how Want could automagically handles URIs on behalf of task
writers.</p>
<h2>Test Everything that Could Possibly Break</h2>
<p>Things that need testing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>That trying to build undefined targets fails.</li>
  <li>That dependencies to undefined targets produce an error, even if they
    aren't traversed when building the default (or requrested) target.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internationalization</h2>
<p>Want will probably speak only English for ever, but the platforms where
Want runs may be in different locales. Therefore use the locale-friendly
versions of Delphi functions when possible (AnsiUpperCase, AnsiCompareFileNames,
etc.).</p>
<h2>Parsing<br>
(Already Implemented)</h2>
<p>The parser will need to find task classes by their friendly name (i.e. &quot;copy&quot;for
TCopyTask). To acheive this, set up a task registry (a simple TStringList will
do) that maps friendly names (XML tags) to task classes.</p>
<blockquote>
  Implemented! See <code>&lt;want&gt;/src/WantClasses.pas</code> for details.
</blockquote>
<h2>Path Syntax<br>
(Already Implemented, but no URIs yet)</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The software world is divided between the forward slash (/) and the backslash
(\) camps. Windows, which is on the backslash camp, runs over 90% of desktops,
and over 60% of servers, but only a fraction of wordl computers, once you
consider handhelds, celluar phones, and the miriads of devices running embedded
applications. Most everything besides Windows, including the Internet, is on the
forward slash camp.</p>
<p>Kylix, the Linux version of Delphi, is also in the fwd/ camp.</p>
<p>How Want will deal with paths in build scripts needs to be defined.</p>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>For Want users, it would be easier not to think much about path syntax.
Therefore, let Want should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider both &quot;/&quot; and &quot;\&quot; as file separators in a
    path.</li>
  <li>Use &quot;,&quot; and &quot;;&quot; as the path separators in a list of
    paths. Ignoring &quot;:&quot; avoids problems with Windows-style syntax for
    drives (C:, etc.).</li>
  <li>Forbid the use of the above characters for any other purpose when dealing
    with paths.</li>
</ul>
<p>That solves the user problem.</p>
<p>Internally, Want tasks need to have a unique, canonical representation for
paths, and an API to deal with them. Most of the API should be readily
accessible through the abstract TTask class methods.</p>
<p>The canonical form, even if it means more work under Delphi, should probably
be the fwd/ form, which is the one that supports most purposes (file handling,
FTP, HTTP, WAP, XML, etc.).</p>
<p>Canonical paths should be translated to platform dependent ones only by Want
tasks, and only right before passing them to the relevant application or
service.</p>
<p>The aim should be to eventually treat all paths as URIs, as defined by
Internic RFCs. This can be acheived by writing a simple file handling library,
that knows how to convert URIs that refer to files to their platform specific
form.</p>
<h3>Things to Consider</h3>
<p>An URI (a path) path with no protocol (no leading <code>xyz:</code> part)
should default to <code>file:</code></p>
<p>What about Want's non-task path logic, like getting hold of the nearest
build script? Should that also be subject to these considerations?</p>
<p>Kylix already has knowledge about path/file separators. Delphi 6 will too.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Find how Delphi's RTTI will treat a property of a type defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <code>type<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;TWantPath = string;<br>
  </code>
</blockquote>
<p><b>AFTERNOTE:</b> It seems it's irrelevalnt. It should be treated as a
string. If not, define the property as string, and let the code handle the rest.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>[[State how Want currently deals with these issues right here]]</p>
<p>Implemented up to fwd/ style paths that can be translated to System paths
using <code>TTask.ToSystemPath(Path)</code>. The relevant units are <code>WildPaths.pas</code>
and <code>FileOps.pas</code>.</p>
<p>Will probably need help from <code>Indy</code> (Internet Dyrect) components
(also in Kylix) for the rest.</p>
<p>Tested under Windows using Delphi 4.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<h3>Circular Dependencies: Finding the Culprits</h3>
<p>Use the <code>Name=Value</code> facility of TStrings to record which target
produced the inclusion of which target. A dependency circle can then be found by
following the <code>=Value</code> chain until the current target is reached.</p>
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
<p>Methods that are neither public (published), nor virtual, must be private.
This is the Delphi way of things.</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>The most important (most used) tasks, and the ones to implement first should
be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1" bordercolor="black" cellspacing="0"
  summary="important tasks" width="60%">
    <tr>
      <td width="20%">mkdir</td>
      <td>important for project setup.</td>
      <td><b>done!</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>delete</td>
      <td>(including dirs) important for good project cleanup.</td>
      <td><b>done!</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>copy</td>
      <td>important for project setup and bundling.</td>
      <td><b>done!</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>move<br>
        touch</td>
      <td>just handy</td>
      <td><b>done!</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dcc</td>
      <td>Delphi compile</td>
      <td><b>done!</b></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>Tasks that should make it in soon are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1" bordercolor="black" cellspacing="0"
  summary="important tasks" width="60%">
    <tr>
      <td width="20%">rc</td>
      <td>resource compilation</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>Tasks that should be planned are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1" bordercolor="black" cellspacing="0"
  summary="important tasks" width="60%">
    <tr>
      <td>zip</td>
      <td>make a zip file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dunit</td>
      <td>test the software</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<h2>Web Site/Documentation</h2>
<p>The use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) really pays off. Each page should
include as style a &quot;style.css&quot; to be found in the same path
(directory) as the page. The &quot;style.css&quot; style can be composed of
other stlesheet inclusions only.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Writing documentation is always a hassle, and no one ever seems to have the
time to do it right</p>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>Implement <code>EnumAttributes</code> and <code>EnumElements</code> class
methods in <code>TTask</code> that respectively report the tasks accepted
attributes and nested elements.</p>
<p>For bonus points, add support for querying the documentation for attributes
and nested elements by calling the <code>TTask</code> class method:</p>
<pre>
class function TTask.Ussage: string
</pre>
<p>and give want.exe a commandline option to query about any task (the default
version would just provide the list of accepted attributes and nested elements).</p>
<h2>Loadable Task Modules</h2>
<p>Having Want automatically load taks from DLLs should be fairly easy, and
would provide the advantage of not having to recompile Want to add the tasks.</p>
<p>To have Want load taks from DLLs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile all of Want's core units into a .BPL.</li>
  <li>Compile custom tasks into a DLL compiled agains the .BPL (.DCP).</li>
  <li>Use a standard naming convention for task DLLs (i.e., prefix_task.dll
    (Want can easily find them using the facilities provided by WildFiles.pas).</li>
  <li>Place task DLLs in the same directory as want.exe, or in any of the
    directories specified in the appropiate .INI or registry entry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because task units register their tasks using <code>RegisterTask</code>, task
classes would be available to Want immediately after loading the DLL.</p>
