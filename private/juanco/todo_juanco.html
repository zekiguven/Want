    <h1>Want TODO</h1>

    <p><i>Juanco A&ntilde;ez</i></p>

    <h2>Paths</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Currently, a task that deals with files must call AboutToScratchPath
        to check that files outside the current directory branch will not be
        deleted or overwritten. This puts the burden on the task writer, and
        makes mistakes more likely. Instead, do the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Finish porting WANT to the new interface-based JalPaths.</li>
          <li>Provide a restricted implementation of NewPath that will not
            overwrite/delete files outside a given directory branch.</li>
          <li>Make WantClasses classes use the restricted implementation.</li>
          <li>Implement commonly needed stuff like: opening a stream for
            reading/writing, the same for files, and text files: NewPath(./src/file).GetWriteStream,
            NewPath(./src/file).Reset(F)/Rewrite(F), NewPath(...).GetStrings :TStrings;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After that, all task writers have to do is JalPaths for file
        manipulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Classes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>DONE! </b>Must parse all elements and store value of _all_ attributes 
      to support GUI editing.
      Conditional attributes currently make the parser skip elements.
      <li>Make Want capable of analyzing a task/element and
      outputing its XML syntax.</li>

      <li>Implement loadable task/element modules.</li>

      <li><b>DONE! </b>Factor out XML parsing into its own unit. This will reduce
      the set of core classes that loadable modules must link in
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Build Scripts</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>DONE!</b> To avoid any confusion with Ant's build
      scripts, which are named "build.xml", Want's build scripts
      should be named "want.xml", "make.xml", or anything
      different.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FileSets</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>DONE!</b> Turn on the ability for file tasks (touch,
      delete, copy, move) to specify internal &lt;fileset&gt;
      elements.</li>

      <li>
        <b>WILL NOT DO!</b> Implement this (from the Ant docs): 

        <p>There is one "shorthand", if a pattern ends with '/' or
        '\', then '**' is appended. E.g. "mypackage/test/" is
        interpreted as were it "mypackage/test/**".</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>WILL NOT DO!</b> Implement this: filesets with no
      &lt;include&gt; elements have an implicit include of
      "basedir/**".</li>

      <li>
        <b>DONE!</b> Implement this:<br>
         

        <blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;patternset id=&quot;non.test.sources&quot; &gt;
  &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/patternset&gt;
</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This set can be referred to via <code>&lt;patternset
        refid="non.test.sources" /&gt;</code> by tasks that support
        this feature or by FileSets.</p>

        <p>Note that patternsets hold the patterns but do not have
        a basedir. Filesets have an implicit patternset.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Decide on the set of built-in properties to support and
      add them.</li>

      <li><b>DONE!</b> Consider making properties local to
      elements, but inheritable to sub-elements. This would add
      flexibility, and will eliminate the fiddling with properties
      in TWantTask if the subproject's owner was set to the
      TWantTask instance. In other words, properties would have
      the expected scope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attributes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>DONE!</b> Make boolean attributes accept values of
      "yes" and "no".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Targets</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>DONE!</b>Add a "description" attribute/property to
      targets. Ant has one.</li>

      <li><b>DONE!</b>Log the description when the target is
      entered.</li>

      <li><b>DONE!</b>Add a "description" attribute to tasks too.
      Tasks can optionall log it, or they can call inherited
      Execute to do it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Implement htmlhelp task. Use this registry key:<br>
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\HTML Help Workshop\InstallDir
      </li>
      <li><b>DONE!</b> Expose the "basedir" property in the
      &lt;exec&gt;&nbsp; task.</li>

      <li>For testing purposes, it would be useful to define a
      TCheckProperty task:</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
  &lt;checkproperty name=&quot;aname&quot; expectedvalue=&quot;avalue&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>Overload RegisterElement/RegisterTask, and have the
      overloaded version take a Name parameter. This allows for
      task aliasing (tasks that have more than one
      name/xmltag).</li>

      <li><b>DONE!</b> Implement the &lt;tstamp&gt; task.</li>

      <li>Implement the &lt;available&gt; task.</li>

      <li>Implement the &lt;uptodate&gt; task.</li>

      <li>Implement the &lt;fail&gt; task.</li>

      <li>To be consistent with Ant, make&nbsp; ETaskException
      descend from EBuildException and use accross the board.
      Refactor exception classes in general.</li>

      <li>
        <b>WILL NOT DO!</b>According to Ant's docs, the setting of
        attributes/properties is done <b>after</b> the file is
        parsed and all XML elements (and sub-elements) have been
        created. In Want, this would require an additional
        examination of the MiniDOM just before a task is executed.
        Tasks (elements in general) can keep a reference to their
        MiniDOM node for this. 

        <p>Sequence:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Call ParseXML recursively on all elements
          created.</li>

          <li>On the DoExecute method, call a SetAttributes first,
          so elements retrieve their attributes from the recorded
          MiniDOM node. SetAttributes calls Init (currently
          Validate) on the element (The MiniDOM node can be
          released at this point).</li>

          <li>Do 2. on the task's children.</li>

          <li>Execute the task.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>It seems complicated, but it allows for lazy (last
        minute) evaluation of properties.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
